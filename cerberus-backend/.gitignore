# ===================================================================
# Project Cerberus .gitignore
#
# This file tells Git which files it should NOT track.
# CRITICAL: Never commit secrets or environment-specific files.
# ===================================================================

# 1. Dependencies
# This is the most important rule. The node_modules folder can be huge
# and can always be recreated by running `npm install`.
/node_modules

# 2. Secrets & Environment Variables
# NEVER, EVER commit your .env file. It contains your secret keys,
# database passwords, and other sensitive credentials.
# The .env.example file, which has the structure but no values, SHOULD be committed.
.env
.env.*.local
.env.local

# 3. Logs
# Log files are generated during runtime and are specific to an environment.
# They should not be version controlled.
logs/
*.log
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*
lerna-debug.log*

# 4. PM2 Files
# Ignore runtime files generated by PM2. The configuration file
# (ecosystem.config.js) SHOULD be committed.
*.pid
*.pid.log

# 5. Test & Coverage Reports
# These are generated every time you run tests and don't belong in source control.
coverage/
junit.xml

# 6. Build Artifacts
# If you were using a language that compiles (like TypeScript), you would ignore
# the output directory. It's good practice to include these anyway.
dist/
build/
.next/

# 7. Operating System & IDE Files
# These are environment-specific files created by your OS or code editor.
# Ignoring them keeps the repository clean for everyone.

# Windows
Thumbs.db
ehthumbs.db
ehthumbs_vista.db
*.stackdump

# VS Code
.vscode/*
!.vscode/settings.json
!.vscode/tasks.json
!.vscode/launch.json
!.vscode/extensions.json

# macOS (for cross-platform compatibility)
.DS_Store
.AppleDouble
.LSOverride

# JetBrains (WebStorm, etc.)
